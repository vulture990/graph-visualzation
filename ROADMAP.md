# Roadmap

This document outlines the goals set for this project. There might be slight modifications in the roadmap from time to time. You are welcome to submit pull requests.

### 1. UI
- Improve the user interface of `unit.html`. We're open to suggestions.
- Add a dark theme (night mode) which can be toggled from the navbar.

### 2. Faster math rendering

D3 Graph Theory currently uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for rendering LaTeX (mathematical symbols) on a webpage. However, [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) is much faster than MathJax for this purpose. We need to convert the LaTeX code of each unit to KaTeX and complete the replacement.

### 3. Add more topics

Here, the aim is to expand the list of chapters (aka units) in order to cover more topics. A list of topics will be updated soon.
